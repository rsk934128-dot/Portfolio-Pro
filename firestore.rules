/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for a personal portfolio website.
 * The core philosophy is to isolate user data, ensuring that users can only access and manage their own information.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * Data is segregated into two main categories: private user-owned data and public/semi-public application data.
 * All user-specific content (profiles, projects, skills, etc.) is stored within a private data tree, making security straightforward and performant.
 * Publicly readable data (like testimonials) and write-only data (like contact submissions) are stored in separate top-level collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All private user data is nested under `/users/{userId}`. This path-based ownership is the foundation of the security model.
 * - /users/{userId}: The user's root profile document.
 * - /users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}: The user's project portfolio.
 * - /users/{userId}/skills/{skillId}: The user's skills.
 * - /users/{userId}/certifications/{certificationId}: The user's certifications.
 * - /users/{userId}/blogPosts/{blogPostId}: The user's blog posts.
 * Top-level collections are used for shared or special-purpose data:
 * - /contactFormSubmissions: A write-only "dropbox" for contact form messages.
 * - /testimonials: A public collection for testimonials.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Ownership: All data under `/users/{userId}` is accessible only by the authenticated user whose UID matches `{userId}`. This prevents users from viewing or modifying each other's data.
 * - No User Listing: It is not possible to list all documents in the `/users` collection, protecting user privacy.
 * - Write-Only Contact Form: Anyone can submit to the `/contactFormSubmissions` collection, but no one can read, update, or delete submissions from the client, protecting the submitter's privacy.
 * - Public Testimonials: The `/testimonials` collection is publicly readable by anyone, but writes are disabled by default until a secure mechanism (like admin roles or ownership fields) is implemented.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * In this prototyping phase, ownership is primarily determined by the document's path (`/users/{userId}`). For the root user profile, relational integrity is enforced on creation by requiring the document's internal `id` field to match the `{userId}` from the path. This avoids costly lookups and ensures data consistency.
